            <p class="history">
                The birth of Black American Sign Language (BASL) can be traced back to the American South during
U.S. segregation. While northern states were varied in their implementation of segregated schooling,
a majority of southern states implemented segregated educational programs and schooling
for black deaf children. After the end of segregation in the United States, integration measures closed black schools and black students were
required to go to what was previously 'whites-only' schools. <br>
The National Black Deaf Advocates (NBDA) became the first the official advocacy organization for
Black Deaf and Hard of Hearing Americans in response to a lack of support, resources, and representation in Black Organizations and Deaf/Disability Organizations during the Civil Rights Movement.
In these environments arose conflict and confusion because black deaf students
signing with BASL could not understand white deaf students signing with ASL.<br>
Black American Sign Language was not respected as a valid form of language and expression,
and through a combination of assimilation, compliance and a lack of resources, it was almost forgotten.
But, despite extreme measures to 1) erase the history and existence of BASL and 2) silence the black deaf community,
many persons and families held onto the language and have continued to pass it down from generation to generation,
evolving and expanding, similar to AAVE.<br>
It is important to not only preserve the history of Black Deaf and Hard of Hearing (HoH) communities and struggles,
and BASL, but to also understand the ways in which we can further support our black deaf and HoH family, friends and folks and recognize,
understand, and resist the continued struggles, discrimination, abuse and lack of representation and awareness afforded to black deaf and HoH communities.
Through the efforts of Dr. Joseph C. Hill and the (other) authors of 'The Hidden Treasure of Black ASL: Its History and Structure',
the first study on and recording of BASL was published.
